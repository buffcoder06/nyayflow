      "Role-based visibility ensures that each team member sees only what is relevant to their work. " +
      "The senior advocate retains full oversight of all matters and financials.",
    category: "general",

      "All data stored on NyayVakil is encrypted at rest using AES-256 and encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3. " +
      "Our servers are hosted in ISO 27001-certified data centres located in India, ensuring your data does not leave Indian jurisdiction. " +

  },
  {
    id: "features-fee-tracking",

      "Tasks can be marked as pending, in-progress, or completed, and you receive a reminder when a task is approaching its due date. " +
      "This is particularly useful for tracking research, drafting, filing, and follow-up actions.",

      "All client data is tied to your account and is not visible to other NyayVakil users.",
    category: "features",
  },
  {
    id: "features-expenses",
    question: "Can I track my own office expenses separately from client expenses?",

      "You can upgrade your plan at any time from within your account settings and the cost difference will be prorated for the remainder of the billing period. " +
      "Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle, so you continue to enjoy your current plan's features until then. " +
