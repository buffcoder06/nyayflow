        <Prose>
          <p>
            <strong>3.1 Location:</strong> We prefer to store all data on
            servers located within India. Where we use third-party cloud
            infrastructure (see Section 6), we endeavour to select providers
            that offer India-based data residency options. Where data is
            processed or stored outside India, we ensure appropriate contractual
            safeguards are in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3.2 Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit using
            TLS (Transport Layer Security). Sensitive data at rest is encrypted
            using industry-standard AES-256 encryption. Passwords are hashed
            using a secure, salted hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) and are
            never stored in plain text.

          <p>
            <strong>3.3 Access Controls:</strong> Access to your data within
            our systems is restricted to authorised personnel on a
            need-to-know basis, subject to confidentiality agreements. We
            maintain audit logs of administrative access to production systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3.4 Security Practices:</strong> We follow industry
            best practices including regular security assessments, vulnerability
            scanning, and responsible disclosure procedures. However, no
            electronic storage or transmission method is 100% secure, and we
            cannot guarantee absolute security.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3.5 Breach Notification:</strong> In the event of a data
            breach that poses a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify
            you and relevant authorities as required by applicable Indian law
            (including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 when in
            full force), without undue delay.
