            NyayVakil is a legal practice management platform built specifically
            for Indian advocates. Our goal is straightforward: help every legal
            professional in India manage their practice with clarity, without the
            chaos of scattered registers, forgotten dates, and untracked fees.

              Talk to most practising advocates in India and you will find the
              same picture: a physical diary for hearings, a notebook or
              register for client matters, a separate ledger or Excel sheet for
              fee collection, and WhatsApp groups for coordinating with clerks
              and juniors. Some of this works — until it does not. A missed
              hearing date, a fee entry that was never recorded, a document that
              cannot be found before a client meeting. The stakes in legal work
              are high, and the tools most advocates rely on were not built for
              this.
            </p>
            <p>
              General-purpose software — CRMs, spreadsheets, calendar apps — can
              be jury-rigged to handle some of this, but they do not understand
              the structure of Indian legal practice. They do not know the
              difference between a matter number and a diary number, they cannot
              track next dates the way a court diary needs to, and they are not
              built around how Indian advocates think about their work.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built NyayVakil because this gap is real and the people who work
              within it deserve better. Indian advocates — whether they are
              handling criminal matters at a district court or civil litigation at
              a High Court — are serious professionals managing complex work with
              significant consequences. The software they use should match that
              seriousness.

              NyayVakil is built by a small team passionate about legal
              technology in India. We work closely with practising advocates —
              from district courts to High Courts — to understand how they
              actually run their practices. Every feature we build is informed by
              real conversations with real practitioners, not assumptions about
              what legal software should do.

              We are a product-focused team, which means we spend more time
              making existing features work well than racing to add new ones. We
              respond personally to support requests. We take feedback seriously.
              And we ship continuously based on what we hear from users.
