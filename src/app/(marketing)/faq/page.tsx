      {
        question: "Who is NyayVakil for?",
        answer:
          "NyayVakil is built for Indian legal professionals — solo advocates, advocates with juniors and clerks, small law firms, and in-house legal departments. If you are managing matters, hearings, clients, and fees in India, NyayVakil is designed for you. Our plans are priced for practices of all sizes.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is it suitable for a solo advocate?",
        answer:
          "Yes, absolutely. The Starter plan is designed specifically for solo practitioners. It gives you a full hearing diary, matter management, fee tracking, and client records — everything you need to run your practice efficiently, without paying for team features you will never use.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can a chamber with junior advocates and a clerk use it?",
        answer:
          "Yes. The Chamber plan supports multiple team members with role-based access. Your clerk can manage the diary and tasks, junior advocates can update matter notes, and you as the senior can see everything. Each person only sees what is relevant to their role.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is my data secure?",
        answer:
          "Yes. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We take automated backups daily so your information is never at risk of being lost. We do not share your data with any third parties. Your client and matter information remains strictly yours.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use NyayVakil just for maintaining a hearing diary?",
        answer:
          "Yes. You can use the hearing diary feature independently without setting up the full matter workflow. Many advocates start with just the diary and gradually adopt other features like fee tracking and client records as they get comfortable with the product.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Do I need any technical knowledge to use NyayVakil?",
        answer:
          "No. NyayVakil is built with simplicity in mind. If you can use WhatsApp and a basic smartphone app, you can use NyayVakil. The interface is in plain English, steps are clearly labelled, and our onboarding process guides you through setting up your practice from scratch.",
      },

  {

    label: "Features",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Does NyayVakil have a court diary or hearing diary?",
        answer:
          "Yes. The hearing diary is one of the core features. It shows all your upcoming hearings date-wise, lets you record next date after each hearing, and sends you reminders before each court appearance. You can filter by court, matter type, or client.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I track fees and pending payments?",
        answer:
          "Yes, fully. You can record professional fees against each matter, mark payments as received, and see at a glance which matters have outstanding amounts. The fee ledger shows a complete history for each client and matter. You can also generate fee summaries for a given period.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does it handle expenses like court fees and travel?",
        answer:
          "Yes. You can record expenses against matters — court fees, stamp duty, travel, miscellaneous costs — and mark whether they have been reimbursed by the client or not. This keeps your matter-level accounts clean and helps at billing time.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Can I store documents like vakalatnamas and court orders?",
        answer:
          "Yes. The document vault lets you upload and attach files to matters — vakalatnamas, court orders, agreements, plaints, replies, and any other documents. Documents are stored securely and can be retrieved quickly by matter or client name.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I send reminders to clients?",
        answer:
          "Yes. NyayVakil supports client reminders via WhatsApp, SMS, and email for upcoming hearings, pending fee payments, and document submission. You can customise the message and timing of reminders from your account settings.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does it have task management for clerks?",
        answer:
          "Yes. You can create tasks, assign them to team members (clerks, juniors, or others), set due dates, and track completion. Tasks can be linked to specific matters so everything stays in context. Clerks get notified when tasks are assigned to them.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are reports available?",
        answer:
          "Yes. NyayVakil includes reports for income and expense summaries (monthly and yearly), matter statistics (active, disposed, pending), outstanding fee reports by client, and hearing frequency by court. Reports can be exported as PDF or CSV.",
      },

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What plans are available?",
        answer:
          "NyayVakil offers four plans: Starter (for solo advocates), Chamber (for advocates with juniors and clerks), Firm (for small law firms with larger teams), and Enterprise (for legal departments and larger organisations with custom requirements). Visit our Pricing page for current rates.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan later?",
        answer:
          "Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately. If you downgrade, the change takes effect at the start of your next billing cycle. There are no penalties for changing plans.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is yearly billing cheaper than monthly billing?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Choosing an annual subscription saves you up to 20% compared to paying month by month. The discount is applied automatically when you select the yearly billing option at checkout.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a free trial? Do I need a credit card?",
        answer:
          "Yes, we offer a 14-day free trial on all plans. No credit card is required to start the trial. You can explore all features of your chosen plan freely. At the end of the trial, you can subscribe or your account will simply pause — your data is retained for 30 days.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?",
        answer:
          "If you cancel, your data is retained for 30 days after the cancellation date. During this period, you can export everything — matters, clients, hearings, fees, and documents. After 30 days, data is permanently deleted. We will send you reminders before deletion so you have time to export.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "Does NyayVakil work on mobile?",
        answer:
          "Yes. NyayVakil is fully mobile responsive and works well on smartphones and tablets. Whether you are in court, at a client meeting, or travelling, you can check your hearing diary, update matter notes, and record fee payments from your phone browser without needing to install a separate app.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need a constant internet connection?",
        answer:
          "NyayVakil is a cloud-based application and requires an internet connection to access your data. Most features require an active connection. We recommend a stable connection when uploading or downloading documents. Basic browsing on a standard mobile data connection works well for day-to-day use.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Can I migrate my existing data into NyayVakil?",
        answer:
          "Yes. You can import existing matters and client records using our CSV import tool. We also offer onboarding support for Chamber and Firm plan subscribers, where our team helps you migrate data from spreadsheets or your previous software. Contact us to discuss your specific situation.",
      },
      {
        question: "Which browsers are supported?",
        answer:
          "NyayVakil works on all modern browsers — Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge. We recommend keeping your browser up to date for the best experience. Internet Explorer is not supported.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What support options are available?",
        answer:
          "All plans include email and in-app chat support. Chamber and Firm plan subscribers also get priority support with faster response times. Enterprise plan customers get dedicated phone support and a named account manager. You can also reach us on WhatsApp during office hours.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Is onboarding training provided after I sign up?",
        answer:
          "Starter plan subscribers get access to our written help centre and video tutorials. Chamber and Firm plan subscribers receive a personalised onboarding session with one of our team members, where we help you set up your practice, import existing data, and answer your questions.",
      },
      {
        question: "How quickly are issues resolved?",
        answer:
          "For Starter plan subscribers, we aim to respond within 24–48 hours on business days. Chamber and Firm plan subscribers receive priority responses, typically within a few hours. Critical issues affecting your ability to access the product are treated as highest priority across all plans.",
